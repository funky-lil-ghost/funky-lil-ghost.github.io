  <p>"you have to distinguish yourself from everyone else" "the job market is competitive, you have to take every opportunity to make yourself look better than the rest"</p>
  <p>i hate it</p>
  <p>i dont want it</p>
  <p>why d o i havet o compete. why cant i just exist. why cant we all just exist. i dont want to "market" myself as a provider of goods and services. i want to say hi. i am a person. i have flaws. everyone has flaws no matter how much we try to cover them up. why am i suppposed to exaggerate my goodness and minimize my faults. disingenuous. i have passions and loves and opinions and flaws and sadnesses. and i am a person. thats all. lets be people and try to make something worthwhile out of our loves and flaws.; thats all.</p>
